Step 1: GitHub Setup

Forked the CSN150 Documentation Template repository from https://github.com/ereedsanchez/CSN150-Doc-Template
.

Created this fork to document my ESP32-CAM setup process.

I’ll use this repository to track installation steps, screenshots, and notes for future assignments.

Step 2: Arduino IDE Installation (In Progress)

Downloading and installing the Arduino IDE from the official site: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/
.

Will include screenshots once the installation is complete.

Step 3: ESP32-CAM Setup (To Be Completed)

Planning to follow the Last Minute Engineers ESP32 Arduino IDE tutorial to install board drivers and test the blink sketch.

Documentation will be updated once the ESP32 is connected and tested successfully.
